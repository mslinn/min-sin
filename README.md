# `min-sin`, a Minimal Sinatra Webapp

This minimal Ruby Sinatra project shows how to set up `sinatra_activerecord` with databases for test, production and development.
To learn more, please read [Sinatra ActiveRecord](https://www.mslinn.com/blog/2023/04/14/sinatra-activerecord-db.html).

This is a *very* minimal webapp ... so minimal, it does not even have a file called `app.rb`.
Even so, all the Active Record `rake` tasks work.

Feel free to use this app as the basis for your next Sinatra webapp.
